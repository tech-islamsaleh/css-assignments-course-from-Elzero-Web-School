## Assignments

### Assignment 01

- Do the following format taking into account the following information
- The parent component that contains all the internal elements is 800px
- The parent element does not have Padding
- The distances between the right and left internal elements (Gap) are 15px
- The distances between the internal elements from the bottom and the top are 15px
- You should not calculate the width of the item yourself and it should be Dynamic because we are going to change the width of the parent component
- Change the width of the parent component to 1000px and make sure nothing is ruined

### Assignment 02

```
<div class="normal">Normal</div>
<div class="one">One</div>
<div class="two">Two</div>
```

```
div {
  margin: 20px auto;
  width: 300px;
  font-weight: bold;
  font-size: 1rem;
  padding: 20px;
  background-color: ???; /* Get The Background From Image */
  color: black;
}
```

- Use the previous structure and its formats to make the same shape
- The background of all elements is the same as the background of the first element but with different transparency
- The transparency rate for the last two elements is 0.1, but how the shape appears as in the picture
